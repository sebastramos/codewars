// Add an item to the list:

// AddExtra method adds a new item to the list and returns the list. 
// The new item can be any object, and it does not matter.
// (lets say you add an integer value, like 13)

// In our test case we check to assure that the returned list has one more item than the input list.
// However the method needs some modification to pass this test.

// P.S. You have to create a new list and add a new item to that.

console.log(addExtra([1,2,3]))
// 4
console.log(addExtra([1,2]))
// 3
