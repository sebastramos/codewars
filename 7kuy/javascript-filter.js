// While developing a website, you detect that some of the members have troubles logging in.
// Searching through the code you find that all logins ending with a "_" make problems.
// So you want to write a function that takes an array of pairs of login-names and e-mails, and outputs an array of all login-name, e-mails-pairs from the login-names that end with "_".

// You have to use the filter-method which returns each element of the array for which the filter-method returns true.


function searchNames( logins ){
  return logins.filter(el => console.log(el[0]))
}

console.log(searchNames([ [ "foo", "foo@foo.com" ], [ "bar_", "bar@bar.com" ] ]))
// [ [ "bar_", "bar@bar.com" ] ]

console.log(searchNames([ "foo", "foo@foo.com" ], [ "bar_", "bar@bar.com" ]))
