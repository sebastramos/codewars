// Peter lives on a hill, and he always moans about the way to his home.
// "It's always just up.
// I never get a rest".
// But you're pretty sure that at least at one point Peter's altitude doesn't rise, but fall.
// To get him, you use a nefarious plan: you attach an altimeter to his backpack and you read the data from his way back at the next day.

// You're given a list of compareable elements:

// heights = [h1, h2, h3, â€¦, hn]
// Your job is to check whether for any x all successors are greater or equal to x.

// If the list is empty, Peter has probably removed your altimeter, so we cannot prove him wrong and he's still right:
