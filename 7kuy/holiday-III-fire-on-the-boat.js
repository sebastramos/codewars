// Enjoying your holiday, you head out on a scuba diving trip!

// Disaster!! The boat has caught fire!!

// You will be provided a string that lists many boat related items.
// If any of these items are "Fire" you must spring into action.
// Change any instance of "Fire" into "~~". Then return the string.

// Solution 1
function fireFight(s){
  return s.split(' ').map(e => e === 'Fire' ? '~~' : e).join(' ')
}

// Solution 2
function fireFight(s){
	return s.replaceAll('Fire', '~~')
}
  
console.log(fireFight("Boat Rudder Mast Boat Hull Water Fire Boat Deck Hull Fire Propeller Deck Fire Deck Boat Mast"))
// "Boat Rudder Mast Boat Hull Water ~~ Boat Deck Hull ~~ Propeller Deck ~~ Deck Boat Mast"
console.log(fireFight("Mast Deck Engine Water Fire"))
// "Mast Deck Engine Water ~~"
console.log(fireFight("Fire Deck Engine Sail Deck Fire Fire Fire Rudder Fire Boat Fire Fire Captain"))
// "~~ Deck Engine Sail Deck ~~ ~~ ~~ Rudder ~~ Boat ~~ ~~ Captain"
